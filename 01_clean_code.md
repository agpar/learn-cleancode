## Chapter 1: Clean Code

Coding isn't going anywhere. No matter how cool and high level the frameworks get, the job of
translating business/customer desires into clear specifications will always exist. The *precision*
needed is not going away.

Good code matters. This should not be surprising or controversial.

Coding messily, quickly and under-pressure can give the appearance of high productivity at the
start, but over time productivity is pushed down asymptotically towards 0.

Often, a growing mess creates a desire for a "grand redesign". This rewrite can take so long and (if
done under pressure) will often require a new "grand redesign" by the time it's done.

Engineers are just as complicit as any other part of the company for allowing this to happen.
Management and marketing do not have the necessary skills to accurately forecast a technical project
engineers need to defend realistic goals and expectations. If we agree to rush and do things poorly,
we're part of the problem.

> All developers with more than a few years experience know that previous messes slow them down. And
> yet all developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines.

The only path towards long term stable productivity is to write good code. The only way to maintain
velocity is to keep the code clean.

Of course, defining what exactly clean code is is not easy. Often it is easy to see when code is
clean or messy, but knowing how to transform the latter into the former is a complex skill.

This book introduces techniques to help build the skill.

As a programmer, you are an author. Yourself and others will read your code a lot. As an author you
have a responsibility to yourself and others to make your work easy to read. Maybe your code will be
read 10 times. Maybe 100. When you are extending your own code, you will read and reread it. In any
case, writing the code happens once, reading many times. Therefore, there is no excuse to try to
"save time" by writing code quickly and badly - if it wastes time for all the readers.

Practice the boy scout rule: always leave code better than you found it. Would any other option
really be professional?
